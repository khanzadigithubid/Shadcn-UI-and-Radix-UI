                    <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: What is Redux?</h3>
                    <p>A: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, primarily used with React for managing the state of the application in a single, centralized store.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: Why should I use Redux?</h3>
                    <p>A: Redux provides a clear structure for managing state, making it easier to maintain and debug applications, especially as they grow in complexity.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: How do I set up Redux in my React application?</h3>
                    <p>A: You can set up Redux by installing the Redux and React-Redux libraries, creating a store, defining actions and reducers, and wrapping your application with the <code className="bg-gray-700 p-1">Provider</code> component.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">

                    <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: What is the difference between Redux and Context API?</h3>
                    <p>A: While both Redux and Context API are used for state management, Redux is more powerful for larger applications due to its middleware support, dev tools, and predictable state updates, while Context API is simpler for smaller applications or for passing props deeply.</p>
